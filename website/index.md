## Course Overview

This course is an introduction to fixed income markets and the analytic tools used by participants in these markets. Fixed income markets have been changing dramatically over the past few years, especially after the financial crisis. New regulation, aggressive monetary policy that led to zero nominal rates, large expansions of government debt, new empirical behavior of Treasury securities, design of new securities have had and continue to have major impact on how fixed income markets work. By its nature, fixed income is a very broad subject that would literally take years to cover in depth. Of necessity, this course needs to be selective. To strike a balance between coverage and institutional details we will focus primarily on the fundamental concepts underlying fixed income markets; with a solid grasp of the underlying theory, it should be much easier to pick up the rest while working in the industry. The course will be quantitative with lots of formulas and number crunching. However, we will cover advanced real-world models and valuation techniques used by many banks and hedge funds which is an important asset to have in the competitive world of Wall Street.

## Prerequisites
FINC 311 (Principles of Finance) and 314 (Investments) are prerequisites. A good understanding of basic algebra, calculus, and statistics is key to mastering the material covered in this course. It will also be useful if you already have some familiarity with: Present Value, compounding of interest rates, the CAPM, Black-Scholes. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, it will simply mean a little bit more work for you as we go through the associated topics in class.
